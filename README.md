# Aqueduct data comparison

This repo quickly assess the changes in the WRI Aqueduct Baseline Water Stress layer between [version 3 (2019)](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-30-data) and [version 4 (2023)](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-40-data).
Then, it assess what is the impact of this change in the [SBTN State of Nature Water layers](https://zenodo.org/records/7797979).

The short conclusion is that 17% of basins show lower risk than the previous version. In the image below, negative values represent basins where the SBTN max water availability value decreased (i.e., show lower risk than the previous version), and positive values represent basins where the SBTN max water availability value increased (i.e., show higher risk than the previous version).
